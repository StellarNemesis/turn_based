2. Pick a player to fight, if the player accepts then the fight begins.
3. Each players take turns attacking, during an action (:crossed_swords:) BOTH PLAYERS DM mesome your turn choice, ties favor attacking player. Post your stats and any effects you have on you at the end of each turn
4. If you win a fight you get 1 level.
